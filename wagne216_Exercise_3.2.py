    f()
    
def print_spam(): # print string input 'spam' 
    print('spam')

do_twice(print_spam) # print "spam" twice

# 2 modify do_twice to include 2 arguments (inputs)
def do_twice(function, input): #create function that still repeats an input function
    function(input) 
    function(input)

# command
do_twice(print,'spam')  
 
# 3 Copy print_twice, from ThinkPython2 pg 21
def print_twice(bruce):
